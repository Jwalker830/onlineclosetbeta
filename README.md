# How to use theOnlineCloset

## 1. Create an account

    a. Click the Login Button and set up an account using your
       google email.

## 2. Add items

    a. Take a picture of your item and click, “Click to upload a
       garment” to select which garments you want uploaded.
          i. Make sure your clothes are well lit, and the picture
             has a contrasting background in order for the
             background to be properly removed.
          ii. You must add at least 1 top, bottom, and shoe in
             order to access the closet

    b. Be sure to add a lot of clothes, the more the merrier!

    c. Each item must have at least a title and some tags
       i. Titles don’t have to be specific but other users will be
          able to see them.
       ii. Tags are important, make sure your tagging
       conventions are consistent across items for best
       results. ex: “gray” vs “grey” vs “Gray”. Each separate
       tag should be separated by a comma.
       iii. Your algorithm will be more effective the more
       granular your tags are. Be as descriptive as you like.

          the outfit a score of 4, 3, 2, and 1, respectively.

       algorithm will be!
